What I learned
I learnt responsive website. I've been working on javascript for a while. This refreshed my memories of HTML and CSS. The use of autofit using repeat() and minmax()was also one thing that was fun.

Continued development
I'll still like to understand how to use javaScript for mobile toogle. i had a tough time with it. i had to eventually use css.
