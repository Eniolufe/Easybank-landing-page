### What I learned

I learnt responsive website. I've been working on javascript for a while. This refreshed my memories of HTML and CSS. The use of autofit using repeat() and minmax()was also one thing that was fun.

### Continued development

I'll still like to understand how to use javaScript for mobile toogle. i had a tough time with it. i had to eventually use css.
